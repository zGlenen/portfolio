                        I've been working with Rockound Productions since 2017. Throughout my time there,
                        I've mentored under multiple people, and worked many different events and festivals as a tech. While my duties would 
                        vary for every gig, they include stage managing, being a backline technician,
                        live sound, and set-up & tear-down of all technical equipment.

                        During my time with Halifax Jazz Festival, I've assumed multiple roles. Currently, I am a Site & Logistics
                        manager. My duties include set-up & tear-down of entire site, working with vendors and other teams to accomplish
                        their needs, and leading volunteer and labour crews.

                        Since 2018, I've been a self-employed event professional. This means that many folks, businesses, and events 
                        around the maritimes would hire me to help manage what they need. This could be from helping a local brewery 
                        run their on-site events, to heading out to Magnetic Hill to work on the headlining summer concert.

                        During the pandemic, I tried an abundance of different hobbies, one being computer programming. This is where my love for
                        coding bloomed, and I decided to go back to school to follow it. In this course, I studied the creation of software, writing practical and effectual code,
                        and following of established design and programming standards.

                        Back-to-back with Recording Arts, I attended Music Business to be more well-rounded and to get a better understanding of the Music Industry.
                        Here I studied all business aspects of the industry including grant-writing, marketing plans, artist management and festival planning among other subjects.

                       I attended this course straight out of high-school with a drive to be apart of any music scene. Here, I studied 
                       multiple aspects of professional recording techniques such as mixing, mastering, post-production and producing. During
                       my year, I cultivated a strong love for technology and how it can manipulate music.
