                    Since December 2023, I've been in the development of a personal project known as Films Wrapped. 
                    As a dedicated user of Letterboxd, a renowned social media platform for film enthusiasts, I meticulously document each movie I watch. 
                    In December, Letterboxd introduced a feature called Letterboxd Wrapped, where they showcase users' viewing statistics, 
                    including the number of films watched, top directors, and peak viewing weeks. 
                    However, I found the provided data to be lacking, sparking a desire to create a more comprehensive solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Motivated by this vision, I began to create my own version of the statistics, 
                    drawing insights from Letterboxd watchlists, activity logs, and leveraging The Movie Database. 
                    While the project remains a work in progress, I take immense pride in its evolution thus far. 
                    Serving as the sole designer and developer, I've dedicated countless hours to its realization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What initially began as a rudimentary script has evolved into a sophisticated web scraping web application.
                    With each milestone achieved, I delve deeper into various programming languages and innovative solutions.

                    In June 2022, I completed a 5-week work-term for a Maker Space based out of Sydney, Cape Breton.
                    Their goal was to create a "practice microphone"  designed to integrate with real-time headphone monitoring capabilities.
                    The I/O was to be programmed with multiple effects such as delay, distortion, and compression, which 
                    could be switched on and off as the user pleased. My primary responsibility during this tenure was to engineer the reverb effect module for the device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Convolution reverb consists of an impulse sample (a small recording of a clap in any room would do) and an input
                    source merged together to artificially create the reverb of said room. My project is in C++ and I worked 
                    off of an old repository the head engineer had. During my term, I researched how to break down audio files in
                    C, fourier transformations, and digital signal processing. In the end, I merged many open-source audio processing 
                    libraries together to acheive the end goal. The project took me the full 5 weeks to complete, finishing on the final day.

            YourFolio represents the culmination of an enriching capstone project undertaken during my time at NSCC. 
            This innovative platform serves as a versatile solution for students seeking to showcase their e-portfolios seamlessly, with a user-friendly interface. 
            As one of seven dedicated team members, I assumed dual responsibilities as a front-end developer and the lead for branding initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was challenging but most importantly, immensely rewarding. It was my first foray into ASP.NET and working on a development project in a 
                    group setting. Our goal with this project was to create something that would have a lasting effect for us as developers and perhaps for future students.

                <p><br/>
                    This Ecosystem Simulation was a final project for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming course. This simulation consists of 
                    two types of organisms, humans and zombies circumnavigating a grid-like city.The zombies will eat humans if they
                    see them. In a certain number of rounds, the humans will spawn other humans if they have survived, 
                    and the zombies will convert back to humans if they have not eaten. The challenge here was to have the two organisms
                    co-exist in the same space for a duration of 400 round without an extinction. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was challenging but very rewarding. The trick to having both organisms survive is to
                    have a programmed bias where one chooses how the zombies first spawn. Here, I forced the initial zombie spawn to be in the 
                    seperate four quadrants to ensure that there would be no "zombie-wall" taking over the city. In the end I was able to have the 
                    organisms survive for a TBD (perhaps infinite) amount of generations.

                    This transit tracker, written in JavaScript, fetches an API every 15 seconds containing various data points from the transit
                    system. The bus images are updated with coordinates and bearings. This project was very fun and solidified how 
                    to manipulate data from API for me.

                    This word processor was a project under my  Data Structures course. The purpose is to create a command line

                    could be reused for any number of future projects.
