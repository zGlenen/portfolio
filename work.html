                    In June 2022, I completed a 5-week work-term for a Maker Space based out of Sydney, Cape Breton.
                    Their goal was to create a "practice microphone" that would plug into an I/O and have headphones out.
                    The I/O was to be programmed with multiple effects such as delay, distortion, and compression, which 
                    could be switched on and off as the user pleased. I was tasked with creating the reverb effect for the device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Convolution reverb consists of an impulse sample (a small recording of a clap in any room would do) and an input
                    source merged together to artificially create the reverb of said room. My project is in C++ and I worked 
                    off of an old repo the head engineer had. During my term, I researched how to break down audio files in
                    C, fourier transformations, and digital signal processing. In the end, I merged many open-source audio processing 
                    libraries together to acheive the end goal. The project took me the full 5 weeks to complete, finishing on the final day.

                    This Ecosystem Simulation was a final project for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming course. This simulation consists of 
                    two types of organisms, humans and zombies circumnavigating a grid-like city.The zombies will eat humans if they
                    see them. In a certain number of rounds, the humans will spawn other humans if they have survived, 
                    and the zombies will convert back to humans if they have not eaten. The challenge here was to have the two organisms
                    co-exist in the same space for a duration of 400 round without an extinction. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was challenging but most importantly, a blast to code. The trick to having both organisms survive is to
                    have a programmed bias where one chooses how the zombies first spawn. Here, I forced the initial zombie spawn to be in the 
                    seperate four quadrants to ensure that there would be no "zombie-wall" taking over the city. In the end I was able to have the 
                    organisms survive for a TBD (perhaps infinite) amount of generations.

                    Word Processor</h2>

                    This word processor was a project under my current Data Structures course. The purpose is to create a command line
                    text editor complete with insert, append, delete, list, and save functionality. The processor was built on top of 
                    a my linked list data structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key to this project was to make each different aspect of it as reusable as possible. This means that throughout 
                    my code, I've made methods that are completely self contained. The files themselves with a simple switch of data-type,
                    could be reused for any number of future projects.
